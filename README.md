Tired of building web-applications for your machine learning models to enable users to interact with it? ML-Starter lets you focus on your model performance rather than writing backend- and frontend-code. ML-Starter is built on FastAPI and React. Its integration with Docker allows you to run your application locally or deploy it to a hosting provider such as www.heroku.com.

<sup>Alpha Version: Only suggested for experimental usage.</sup>
